Forms - HTML Elements that allow to collect data
Form control/widgets - each form element like text field, dropdown etc
Form data - data that is associated with the form element typically sent to server for CRUD operations
Form action - url that will be invoked on form submit. if the action is empty, it will be submitted to the same url
form method - GET/POST etc

Why do we need to put all the form elements in form element?
  1. semantically correct
  2. we can use action or method attribute
  3. allows your form to be properly included in the DOM - document.forms
